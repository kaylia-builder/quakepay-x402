## Automated verification

- CI runs: https://github.com/kaylia-builder/quakepay-x402/actions
- `npm run check`: passed (12 tests)
- Manifest validation: passed against the official Kite x402 schema

## Paid 2xx examples

Record one successful paid request for every endpoint. Include the response,
timestamp, and transaction hash or Kite Passport activity identifier.

Run `npm run testnet:paid-smoke` with a dedicated Kite testnet payer. The
gitignored `testnet-paid-evidence.json` output contains the timestamp, payer,
endpoint URLs, and settlement transaction hashes needed below.

record it here without exposing credentials.
